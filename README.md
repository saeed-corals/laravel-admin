During years of Laravel development, one of the main issues we always ran into is selecting the right dashboard admin panel, in many times we spent days comparing and analyzing and ending up with building the project from scratch, for many reasons: Low-quality code, lack of main features, complexity in understanding the structure and extend it, and ending with poor support of their authors.

## The Birth of Laraship:

in 2016 Corals team has decided to build their own Laravel Administration panel, learning from issues they ran into and poured years of, and the idea grew until it reached to what Laraship is now.
